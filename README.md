Contextualizing AI in finance: This task immerses you in the real-world application of AI in finance. 

Identifying key financial indicators: The ability to discern which data points are critical for financial assessment is fundamental. 

## Determining important factors for AI integration

Data quality assessment: The success of AI heavily depends on the quality of data it is fed. Through this task, we identify and extract high-quality, relevant financial data, setting a strong foundation for accurate AI modeling.

Understanding data structure: AI models require data in specific formats. This task comprehends the structuring of financial data, which is a pivotal step in preparing it for AI integration.

Project context:

Our goal is to extract meaningful insights from 10-K financial reports.
These insights will feed into the AI chatbot, enabling it to provide in-depth financial performance analysis.
